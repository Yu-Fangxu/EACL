M	Yeah, I understand that ma'am.  I don't know what they said to you, but you need to be in a different line.	xxx
F	What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?	fru

M	I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid.	fru
F	Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	ang
M	It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.	fru
F	Why not?	ang
M	There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.	fru
F	Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?	fru

Something crazy could happen tomorrow.	Something crazy can happen for you tomorrow and you'll get a job.  You never know.  You can walk up to somebody on the street and it'll be something great.

M	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	neu
F	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	neu
M	And you couldn't find it?	fru
F	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	fru
M	Are you sure?	neu
F	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	fru
M	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	fru
F	Okay.	fru
M	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	neu
F	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	fru
M	Sentimental value.	neu
F	--really important stuff.	xxx
M	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	neu
F	That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back.	xxx
M	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	neu
F	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	fru
M	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	neu
F	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	ang
M	Well,	neu
M	Obviously ma'am.	fru
M	I am sorry, ma'am.	fru
M	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	neu
M	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	neu
F	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	ang
M	Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?	xxx
F	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	ang
M	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	neu
F	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	ang
M	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	fru
M	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	fru
F	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	ang
M	Right. Yes, ma'am.	fru
F	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	ang
M	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	fru
F	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	ang
M	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	neu
F	No.	xxx
M	Well, my hands are really tied then.	neu
F	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	fru
M	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	neu
F	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	fru
M	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	neu
F	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	fru
M	Uh, so it was really heavy.	neu
F	So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.	xxx
M	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	fru
F	There's nothing else you can do?	fru
M	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	neu
F	I don't believe that for a second.	ang
M	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	neu
M	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	fru
F	No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.	xxx
M	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	neu
F	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	ang
M	makes up?	neu
F	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	ang
M	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	neu
F	You could go into the computer and- you know- print-	xxx
M	I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.	xxx
F	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	fru
M	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	fru
F	And you have no guarantee.	fru
M	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	fru
F	This is ridiculous.	fru
M	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	fru
F	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	fru
M	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	fru
F	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	fru
M	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	fru
F	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	ang
M	Right.	neu
F	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	ang
M	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	fru
M	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	neu
F	okay fine.	xxx
M	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	neu
F	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	fru
M	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	neu
F	Thanks.	fru
M	You have a wonderful day.	neu

M	What's wrong Melissa?	xxx

M	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	sad
F	Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,	sad
F	metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-	sad
M	That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?	sad
F	Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.	sad
F	[BREATHING]	sad
M	I am so sorry,  It's-	sad
M	It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?	sad
F	Kind of.	sad
F	It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	sad
M	Absolutely, absolutely.	sad
M	It's the think	sad
F	I just, I don't know.	sad
M	There's no reason for it.	sad
F	I know.	sad
F	And he could of...  He was pretty awesome	sad
M	Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?	sad
F	Uh,  We grew up together.	sad
M	yeah.	sad
M	Is he an actor too, or-?	neu
F	Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.	sad
F	I feel really bad for his family, you know.	sad
M	Yes of course, of course.	sad
F	It must be really, really hard to lose a child.	sad
M	Was he very close to his family?	neu
F	Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-	sad
M	yeah.	neu
F	[BREATHING]	sad
F	I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	sad
M	Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	sad
F	Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.	sad
M	Of course. If there's anything I can do, you just let me know.  Okay?	xxx
F	Thank you.	sad
M	Of course.	xxx
M	Is there a funeral planned? or-	neu
F	Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.	sad
M	Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.	neu
F	Thanks.	sad
M	No problem.	neu
F	It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	sad
F	something happens and they die and it's like-	sad
F	really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.	sad
M	Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.	sad
M	yeah.	neu
F	[BREATHING]	sad
M	Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.	neu
F	yeah.	sad
M	That's the best way to put it.	neu
F	It's hard to say good-bye.	sad
M	Absolutely.	neu
F	[BREATHING]	sad
M	Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.	neu
F	[LAUGHTER]	xxx

M	Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong.	fru
M	Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.	ang
F	Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?	neu
M	I got it in the mail.	fru
F	In the mail?	neu
M	yeah	fru
F	So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?	neu
M	Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-	fru
F	Okay.	neu
M	like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.	fru
F	Okay.	neu
F	All right. I-	xxx
F	Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...	neu
M	Okay.	fru
F	if I call it up on the screen.	neu
M	Okay, great, go ahead.	neu
F	So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?	neu
M	It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.	fru
F	Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-	neu
M	Wow.  I can't believe you're actually admitting to having a problem on your end.  That's a first.	xxx
F	Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	neu
M	No, No, No, I am grateful.	neu
M	Absolutely.	xxx
F	Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.	neu
M	Did they take-	neu
F	You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?	neu
M	Yes, yes, exactly.	neu
F	Yeah so- That --that did go through.	neu
M	Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?	neu
F	Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.	neu
M	Because I paid it on time.	fru
F	Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.	neu
M	Right.	neu
M	Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.	fru
F	Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.	neu
M	Really?	sur
F	yeah.	neu

F	bye bye	neu
M	bye	xxx

F	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	sad
M	He saw it.	sad
F	How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.	xxx
M	He was out here when it broke.	sad
F	When?	xxx
M	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	sad
F	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?	xxx
M	I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	sad
F	Did you talk to him?	sad
M	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	sad
F	He cried hard.	sad
M	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	sad
F	He is thinking about him again.	sad
F	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	sad
M	I guess, he is.	sad
F	What's the meaning of that?	sad
M	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	sad
F	What?	xxx
M	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	sad
F	What do you mean, dishonest?	xxx
M	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	sad
F	What are you going to do, argue with him?	xxx
M	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	fru
M	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	fru
F	You can't just say that to him.	xxx
M	We have to say it to him!	fru
F	How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?	xxx
M	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	ang
F	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	fru
M	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	fru
F	The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--	xxx
M	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	fru
M	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	sad
F	why?	xxx
M	You know.	fru
F	Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	neu
M	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	neu
F	Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.	xxx
M	You know that's not just my business.	fru
F	What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?	xxx
M	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	fru
F	Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them	xxx
M	Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?	xxx
M	You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!	xxx
F	I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	fru
M	She's not Larry's girl!	xxx
F	As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.	xxx
F	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	fru
M	I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	fru
F	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	neu
M	To hell with that!	ang
F	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	neu
M	I want to get this settled first.	xxx
F	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	neu
M	Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	xxx
F	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	neu
M	So what, I'm not fast with women.	fru
F	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	neu
M	Because it is.	fru
F	well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.	xxx
M	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	fru
F	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	fru
F	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	sad
M	All right, then, Mom.	fru
F	Give it some more thought.	xxx
M	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	fru
F	What the hell is this?	ang
M	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	fru
F	Are you crazy?	ang
M	I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.	xxx
F	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?	fru
M	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?	ang
F	Must you be inspired?	xxx
M	Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?	xxx
F	Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!	fru
M	Then help me stay here.	xxx
F	All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!	ang
M	I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.	xxx
F	All right, but don't think like that.	xxx
M	I am thinking like that.	xxx
F	I don't understand you, do I?	fru
M	No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	xxx
F	Yeah, I can see that.	xxx

F	Why did you invite her here?	xxx
M	Why does that bother you?	neu
F	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?	neu
M	Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	neu
F	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	xxx
M	What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	neu
F	He's not going to marry her.	xxx
M	How do you know he is even thinking about it?	fru
F	It's got that about it.	xxx
M	Well, so what.	fru
F	What's going on here, Joe?	fru
M	Now, listen, Kate, just-	fru
F	She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.	ang
M	You can't read her mind.	xxx
F	She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	fru
M	How do you know why she's waited?	fru
F	Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	fru
M	Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?	fru
F	Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.	fru
M	What do you want me to do? What do you want--	fru
F	I want you to pretend like he's coming back!	ang
M	But, Kate...	fru
F	Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.	ang
M	[LAUGHTER]	fru
F	Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	ang
M	Calm yourself.	fru
F	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.	xxx
M	Calm yourself!	fru
F	Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	ang
M	All right, all right.  Calm yourself.	fru
F	You above all, have got to believe, Joe.	xxx
M	Why me, above all?	xxx
F	You've got to believe. You've got to--	sad
M	What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	ang
F	I can't help it!	ang
M	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	ang

F	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	hap
M	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	hap
F	No, it's good.	hap
F	It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.	hap
M	So you're not sorry you came?	xxx
F	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	hap
M	Why?	sur
F	Well your mother has much as told me to leave.	xxx
M	Well--	xxx
F	Well, you saw that! And you.  You've been-	xxx
M	What?	neu
F	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	sad
M	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	hap
F	I figured they would- your mother at least.	xxx
M	How did you know?	neu
F	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	neu
M	Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	xxx
F	I guess this is why I came.	hap
M	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!	hap
M	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	exc
M	You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	exc
F	Chris, I've been ready for a long time.	xxx
M	Then, he's gone forever-you're sure?	xxx
F	I almost got married two years ago.	xxx
M	Why didn't you?	xxx
F	You started to write me.	xxx
M	You felt something that far back?	xxx
F	Every day since.	xxx
M	Annie, why didn't you say something to me?	xxx
F	Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.	xxx
M	Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-	xxx
M	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	exc
F	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!	hap
M	Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	exc
F	Not like that, you're not.	hap
M	I kissed you.	xxx
F	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?	hap
M	Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.	xxx
F	No, what is it, your mother?	xxx
M	No, nothing like that.	xxx
F	What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.	xxx
M	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	sad
M	I don't know how to start.	xxx
F	It wouldn't work like this.	sad
M	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	sad
M	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	sad
F	yeah sure.	neu
M	Yeah.  I lost them.	sad
F	how many?	sad
M	just about all.	sad
F	Oh gee.	sad
M	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	sad
M	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	sad
M	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	sad
M	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	sad
M	And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-	sad
M	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	sad
M	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	sad
M	And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.	sad
M	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	sad
M	And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	sad
M	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	sad
M	And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.	xxx
F	Do you still feel like that?	neu
M	I I want you now, Annie.	exc
F	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	sad
M	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!	hap
F	What would I do with a fortune?	hap

M	What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--	exc
M	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	exc
F	Fine.	neu
M	Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	exc
M	Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	exc
F	What flashlight?	neu
M	The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?	fru
F	It's not your flashlight.	fru
M	Whose is it?	fru
F	It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.	xxx
M	Well, Sure.	fru
F	I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?	fru
M	No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?	fru
M	Well, I hope the moon stays out.  Well, I wonder do they always wander during a full moon?  I can't remember, wasn't it full last year?  Do you remember?	xxx
F	yes.	neu
M	Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?	exc
M	I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.	exc
M	[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around	exc
F	I am cold.	xxx
M	you want my jacket?	exc
F	It's after eleven, let's go home.	neu
M	Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.	xxx
F	There is no point in coming out here.	fru
M	Right.	exc
F	That's my point.	xxx
M	That's my point too.	xxx
F	So let's go.	fru
M	No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?	xxx
F	Not particularly.	neu
M	Why not?	fru
F	I just don't.	neu
M	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	exc
M	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	exc
F	Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	fru
M	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	exc
M	This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah	exc
F	What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.	fru
M	Yeah they do.	xxx
M	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	exc
M	There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.	exc
F	I am just not.	neu
M	For real?	sur
F	Yes.	neu
M	I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.	xxx
F	Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	fru
M	We weren't in a good spot.	fru
F	We didn't see them the first time either.	fru
M	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.	xxx
M	Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?	exc
M	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.	exc
M	Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	exc
M	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	exc
M	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	exc
F	That's the wind.	xxx
M	Well, So what do you think?	exc

M	Well, so?  What do you think?	exc
F	About what?	xxx
M	What I was just saying.	fru
F	It's ridiculous.	xxx
M	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	neu
F	It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.	xxx
M	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	neu
F	Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start	xxx
M	Are we talking about the same thing?	xxx
F	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	fru
M	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	neu
F	God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	ang
M	What's bugging you?	fru
F	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	fru
M	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	fru
F	For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.	fru
M	Why not?	fru
F	We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.	fru
M	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	fru
F	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	fru
M	Well We will see them this year.	neu
F	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	fru
M	I thought you wanted to see it.	fru
F	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	fru
M	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	fru
F	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	fru
M	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	fru
M	When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.	xxx
M	Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage.	xxx
F	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	sad
F	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	sad
F	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	hap
M	Wait a minute, I got it.	neu
F	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	sad
M	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.	xxx
F	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	sad
M	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	exc
F	No.	sad
M	You want me to go get some champagne?	exc
F	No.	sad
M	Take off our shoes?	exc
F	No.	fru
M	What, you want me to whisper in your ear?	xxx
F	No.	xxx
M	You want to get married again?	fru
F	No.	xxx
M	What? What You want a divorce?	fru
F	No no.	fru
M	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	fru
F	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	fru
M	What.  Welcome to the human race.	ang
M	You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.	xxx
M	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	fru
M	Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	xxx
F	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	sad
M	Yes it is.	xxx
F	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	sad
M	Right.	xxx
F	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	sad
M	No, I know me either.	sad
F	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	sad
M	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	sad
F	I didn't say that.	sad
M	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	sad
F	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	sad
M	Yeah?	xxx
F	For heaven's sake, don't you know that?	xxx
F	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	sad
M	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	hap
F	Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	hap
M	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	hap
F	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	hap
M	Well, look what we have got here.	hap
F	Augie, you bought refreshments.	xxx
M	Well, it's not champagne.	xxx
F	Well than we don't need glasses.	xxx
M	Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?	xxx
F	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.	hap
M	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	hap
F	Or not.	xxx
M	Or not.	hap

M	Good God.	exc
F	You think it's them?	xxx
M	I wonder.	exc
F	Freda is the only one who knows we're up here, and she wouldn't call up.	xxx
M	It must be them then.	xxx
F	What will be do?	xxx
M	We're all right, darling, aren't we whatever happens?	xxx
F	Now and always my sweet.	xxx
M	I don't care then.	xxx
F	It was bound to happen sooner or later.	xxx
M	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	exc
F	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	exc
M	Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	fea
F	Behave exquisitely.	exc
M	With the most perfect poise.	exc
F	Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	exc
M	[LAUGHTER] Oh, the things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?	xxx
F	Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.	xxx
M	Darling, don't say that.	xxx
F	Well, it's true.	xxx
F	The whole business is really rather ridiculous.	neu
M	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	xxx
F	Meaning exactly that.	neu
M	What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	exc
F	Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.	xxx
M	You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.	xxx
F	Who's they?	neu
M	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.	exc
F	Well, if I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.	xxx
M	Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].	exc
F	Well, what if-what happens when our love-	neu
F	How long will it last, this overbearing love of ours?	xxx
M	Who knows?	exc
F	Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	xxx
M	No, that fire will fade along with our passion.	exc
F	Oh, dear, shall we like that?	xxx
M	It all depends on how well we played.	exc
F	Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?	neu
M	Yes, yes, with all his might.	exc
F	Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?	xxx
M	No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.	exc
F	My dear, I do believe you're talking nonsense.	xxx
M	no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --	exc
M	enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.	exc
M	Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	exc
F	Elliot, worms don't pop.	xxx
M	I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.	xxx
F	Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	xxx
M	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	exc
F	Which particular one?	xxx
M	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	exc
F	Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	exc
M	Horrible thing, I hate it.	exc
F	I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	xxx
M	How long did that row last?	exc
F	It went on intermittently for days.	xxx
M	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	exc
F	Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.	xxx
M	Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?	exc
F	That was the first time you ever hit me.	xxx
M	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	neu
F	And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	exc
M	[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.	exc
F	Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous	hap
M	Oh, we were very much younger then.	exc
F	And very much sillier.	xxx
M	Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	exc
F	You knew there was nothing.	neu

M	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	xxx
F	You knew there was nothing in that.	neu
M	I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.	xxx
F	Only a trivial little broach.	neu
M	I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.	xxx
F	No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often.	xxx
M	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	xxx
F	You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	neu
M	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	ang
F	maybe just a little, but--	neu
M	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	ang
F	And what of it?	neu
M	What of it?	fru
F	Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.	neu
M	What about me?	xxx
F	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious, you never would have heard about it.	xxx
M	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	ang
F	I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.	fru
M	So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?	neu
F	No.	xxx
M	I'll have a little I think.	neu
F	I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.	neu
M	No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.	xxx
F	Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	neu
M	You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.	xxx
F	It's becoming a habit with you.	neu
M	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	ang
F	Don't be so stupid.	xxx
M	Really, Amanda.	ang
M	Going out somewhere, dear?	xxx
F	Just making myself fascinating for you.	neu
M	Oh, that reply has broken my heart.	ang
F	It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?	xxx
M	As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true.	xxx
F	No, it's not.	xxx
M	Oh, yes it is.	fru
F	Oh, Do shut up.	xxx
M	It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	ang

M	Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	ang
F	Yes, I did quite a bit.	neu
M	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	ang
F	Mind your own business.	ang
M	You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.	ang
F	Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.	ang
M	I'm not the least bit drunk.	xxx
M	I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.	xxx
F	Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.	xxx
M	Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?	xxx
F	Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.	fru
M	Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.	fru

M	The wrong form?	xxx
F	Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	neu

M	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?	fru
F	Sir, don't get an attitude with me.	fru
M	I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.	ang
F	No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.	neu
M	yeah.	xxx
M	right.	xxx
M	Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	fru

M	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?	fru
F	You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.	fru

M	Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.	fru
F	I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.	fru
M	Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?	fru
F	Sir, please don't waste my time.	fru
F	There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.	fru
M	Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	fru
F	They're different forms, we process them all different-	fru
M	Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	ang
F	I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.	fru
F	Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.	fru
M	Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.	fru
F	They're processed differently.	fru
M	That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.	fru
F	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	fru
M	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	fru
F	I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.	ang
M	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	fru
M	That's just dumb.	fru
F	But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.	fru
M	I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!	fru
F	Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.	ang
M	This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.	fru

M	D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?	neu
F	Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	fru
M	This happens every two weeks?	neu
F	Yeah.  That my service just goes out.	fru
M	You've lost your connection.	neu
F	yeah.	fru
M	okay.	neu
F	And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-	fru
M	Hmm.  Mmm.	neu
F	Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.	fru
M	Has somebody tried to pin your site?	neu
F	Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.	neu
M	Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?	neu
F	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	neu
M	Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?	neu
F	Hmm. Mmm.	neu
M	Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --	neu
F	yeah.	neu
F	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	neu
M	Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	neu
F	Oh really?	xxx
M	Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.	neu
F	Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --	neu
M	Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?	neu
F	Uh huh.	neu
M	Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.	neu
F	All right.	neu
M	Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?	neu
F	Yeah, I see that.	neu
M	Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.	neu
F	Okay.	neu
M	And hit enter.	neu
F	Okay.	neu
M	Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?	neu
F	Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.	neu
M	Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.	neu
F	Uh huh, Okay.	neu
M	Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?	neu
F	Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.	neu
M	It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.	neu
F	what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?	xxx
M	Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --	neu
F	Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really?	sur
M	Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.	neu
F	Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.	hap
M	I completely understand.	neu
F	It's so frustrating.	fru
M	Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.	neu
F	Thank you so much.	xxx

F	Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.	hap
M	Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?	neu
F	Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.	hap
M	Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with?	hap
F	No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.	hap
M	All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.	neu
F	Okay.  Thanks.	hap
M	All right.  Bye, bye.	hap

F	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	sad
M	He saw it.	xxx
F	When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?	sad
M	He was out here when it broke.	xxx
F	When?	xxx
M	I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke.	xxx
F	What was he doing out here at four in the morning?	xxx
M	I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen.	xxx
F	Did you talk to him?	sad
M	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	sad
F	He cried hard?	sad
M	I could hear him right through the floor in my room.	xxx
F	What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.	xxx
M	I guess he is.	xxx
F	What's the meaning of that?	xxx
M	I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.	xxx
F	What?	xxx
M	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	xxx
F	What do you mean dishonest?	xxx
M	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	fru
F	What do you want to do, argue with him?	fru
M	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.	fru
M	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	ang
F	You can't say that to him.	xxx
M	We have to say it to him.	fru
F	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	fru
M	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	ang
F	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	fru
M	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	xxx
F	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	ang
M	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	fru
F	Why?	xxx
M	You know.	neu
F	Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?	xxx
M	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	neu
F	Well, that's your business, Chris.	xxx
M	It's not just my business.	fru
F	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	ang
M	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	fru
F	Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't --	xxx
M	Oh, so it isn't just my business?	ang
F	I'm just saying.	fru
M	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	ang
M	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	ang
F	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	ang
M	She is not Larry's girl!	ang
F	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	ang
M	I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.	fru
F	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	neu
M	To hell with that!	ang
F	Have you asked Annie yet?	neu
M	I wanted to get this taken care of first.	xxx
F	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	neu
M	Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	xxx
F	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	neu
M	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	ang
F	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	fru
M	Because it is.	fru
F	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	fru
M	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	fru
F	No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.	fru
M	All right then, mom.	xxx
F	Just give it some more thought.	xxx
M	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	ang
M	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	ang
F	What the hell is this?	sur
M	I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.	ang
F	Are you crazy?	ang
M	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	ang
F	What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?	xxx
M	Yes.  On this, I would.	ang
F	You can't think like that.	xxx
M	Well, you help me stay here.	ang
F	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	ang
M	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	fru
F	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?	ang
M	I am thinking that way.	xxx
F	I don't understand you, do I?	fru
M	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	fru
F	Yeah, I can see that.	fru

F	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	sad
M	He saw it.	xxx
F	What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.	sur
M	He was out here when it broke.	sad
F	When?	xxx

M	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?	fru
F	Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	xxx
M	For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!	fru

M	All right.  All right, just listen.	fru
M	You know why I invited Annie, right?	xxx
F	Why?	xxx
M	You know.	xxx
F	Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?	xxx

M	I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.	fru
F	Don't think like that, do you hear me?	xxx
M	Well, I am thinking like that.	ang
F	I don't understand you, do I?	fru
M	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	ang
F	Yeah, I can see that.	xxx

F	Why did you invite her here?	xxx
M	Why does that bother you?	neu
F	She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?	xxx
M	Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.	neu
F	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	neu
M	What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.	fru
F	He's not going to marry her.	xxx
M	Why do you think he's even thinking that?	neu
F	He's got that about it.	neu
M	Well, so what?	fru
F	What's going on here, Joe?	ang
M	Now listen.	fru
F	No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.	xxx
M	You don't know.  You can't read her mind.	xxx
F	Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.	xxx
M	How do you know why she's waited?	fru
F	Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	xxx
M	Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?	fru
F	Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	xxx
M	Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?	fru
F	I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.	fru
M	But Kate?	fru
F	No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!	fru
F	But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.	xxx
M	Calm yourself.	fru
F	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.	xxx
M	Calm yourself.	fru
F	Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.	fru
M	All right.  All right.	fru
F	You above all have got to believe.	ang
M	What do you mean, me above all?	xxx
F	Just don't stop believing.	xxx
M	What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.	ang
F	I can't help it.	ang
M	What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?	ang

F	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	neu
M	I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?	xxx
F	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	hap
M	So, you're not sorry I came?	exc
F	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	xxx
M	Why?	sur
F	Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	neu
M	Well-	neu
F	You saw that.  And well you've been --	xxx
M	What?	xxx
F	You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.	xxx
M	Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.	xxx
F	I figured they would, your mother at least.	neu
M	How did you know?	xxx
F	Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	neu
M	Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.	xxx
F	Yes, that's why I came.	xxx
M	Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I	xxx
M	I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other.	xxx
M	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	exc
F	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	hap
M	So he's gone forever then?  You sure?	xxx
F	I almost got married two years ago.	sad
M	Why didn't you?	sur
F	You started to write me.	xxx
M	You felt something that far back?	hap
F	Everyday since.	hap
M	Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?	xxx
F	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	exc
M	Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --	xxx
M	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	exc
F	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.	xxx
M	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	exc
F	Not like that you're not.	exc
M	I kissed you.	sur
F	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	sad
M	Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.	sad
F	No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?	xxx
M	No, nothing like that.	sad
F	You have to tell me.	xxx
F	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	sad
M	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.	sad
F	You have to tell me.	sad
M	I don't I don't know where to start.	neu
F	It wouldn't work like this.	sad
M	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	sad
M	You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?	xxx
F	Yeah, sure.	neu
M	I lost them.	sad
F	How many?	sad
M	Just about all.	sad
M	It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.	sad
M	For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.	xxx
M	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.	sad
M	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	sad
M	Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?	xxx
M	And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them.	xxx
M	It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.	sad
M	I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.	xxx
M	So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.	xxx
M	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	sad
M	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	fru
M	you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.	fru
M	And I guess that included you.	sad
F	Do you still feel like that?	sad
M	I want you now, Annie.	sad
F	Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	sad
F	And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	xxx
M	Oh, Annie,	exc
F	[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?	hap
M	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.	hap

M	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?	exc
F	Fine.	sad
M	What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	exc
M	This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	exc
F	What flashlight?	neu
M	The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.	exc
F	You mean our flashlight?	xxx
M	Well-	xxx
F	I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?	xxx
M	Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.	exc
M	How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	exc
F	Yes.	xxx
M	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.	exc
M	I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]	exc
M	Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something	exc
F	I'm cold.	xxx
M	Do you want my jacket?	exc
F	It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.	xxx
M	Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home?	xxx
F	There is no point in coming out here.	xxx
M	Right.	xxx
F	That's my point.	xxx
M	That's my point, too.	xxx
F	So let's go.	xxx
M	Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?	xxx
F	Not particularly.	xxx
M	Why not?	xxx
F	I just don't.	xxx
M	Oh	fru
F	it's stupid.	xxx
M	Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	exc
M	I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.	exc
F	Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	fru
M	Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,	exc
M	and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.	exc
M	I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	exc
F	What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.	fru
M	Yeah, they do.	fru
F	Augie.	fru
M	All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	exc
F	I'm just not.	sad
M	For real?	fru
F	Yes.	xxx
M	I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	fru
F	Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.	fru
M	We weren't in a good spot.	xxx
F	We didn't see them the first time either.	fru
M	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.	xxx
M	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	exc
M	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;	exc
M	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	exc
M	And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	exc
M	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	exc
F	That's the wind.	xxx
M	Well, so what do you think?	exc

M	Well, so, what do you think?	exc
F	About what?	neu
M	What I was just saying.	exc
F	It's ridiculous.	neu
M	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	fru
F	It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.	xxx
M	I'm not the only one, look at all these people.	xxx
F	Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.	xxx
M	Are we talking about the same thing?	xxx
F	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	fru
M	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	neu
F	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	ang
M	What's bugging you then?	fru
F	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	fru
M	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	fru
F	For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion.	xxx
M	Why not?	xxx
F	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	fru
M	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	fru
F	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	ang
M	Well, we'll see them this year.	xxx
F	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	ang
M	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	fru
F	You don't understand anything I am saying.	fru
M	No, of course not.	fru
F	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	sad
M	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	fru
M	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	fru
F	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	sad
F	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	sad
M	Wait a minute.  I've got it.	xxx
F	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	sad
M	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	neu
F	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	sad
M	Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance?	xxx
F	No.	sad
M	Do you want me to go get some champagne?	xxx
F	No.	sad
M	Take off our shoes?	xxx
F	No.	sad
M	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	fru
F	[LAUGHTER] No.	xxx
M	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	fru
F	No.	xxx
M	A vacation?	fru
F	No.	sad
M	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	fru
F	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	sad
M	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	ang
M	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	ang
M	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	ang
F	This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	xxx
M	Yes, it is.	xxx
F	Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	xxx
M	Right.	fru
F	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	sad
M	Now, I know.  Me either	sad
F	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	sad
M	I'm trying the best I can.	sad
F	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	sad
F	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	sad
M	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	sad
F	I didn't say that.	sad
M	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	sad
F	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	sad
M	Really?	sur
F	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	sad
M	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	hap
F	Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.	xxx
M	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	hap
F	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	hap
M	Oh, well look what we've got here.	hap
F	Augie, you brought refreshments.	xxx
M	Well, it isn't champagne.	hap
F	Well, then we don't need glasses.	xxx
M	Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?	xxx
F	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	hap
M	Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.	xxx
F	Or not.	hap
M	Or not.	hap

M	Oh Good God.	xxx
F	Do you think it's them?	fea
M	I wonder.	exc
F	what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	exc
M	Must be them then?	fea
F	What do we do?	exc
M	We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?	neu
F	Now and always, my sweet.	exc
M	I don't care then.	exc
F	It was bound to happen sooner or later.	exc
M	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	xxx
F	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	exc
M	Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.	exc
F	Behave exquisitely.	xxx
M	With the worst- with the most perfect poise?	exc
F	I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	xxx
M	Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--	exc
M	things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	exc
F	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	xxx
M	Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	exc
F	Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	xxx
M	Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.	exc
F	Meaning just that.	xxx
M	Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	exc
F	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	neu
M	You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.	exc
F	Who's they?	neu
M	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.	exc
M	uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	exc
F	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	neu
M	Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.	exc
F	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	xxx
M	[garbage] who knows?	xxx
F	Well, will we always bicker and fight?	neu
M	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	exc
F	Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?	xxx
M	Well, it depends on how well we played.	xxx
F	What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	neu
M	Yes, yes, with all his might.	exc
F	That's rather serious, isn't it?	xxx
M	No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	exc
F	Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense.	xxx
M	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	exc
M	[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	exc
F	Elliott, worms don't pop.	neu
M	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.	exc
F	Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.	xxx
M	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	exc
F	Which particular one?	xxx
M	The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	exc
F	Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.	xxx
M	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	exc
F	I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	exc
M	How long did that roue last?	exc
F	It went on intermittently for days.	xxx
M	Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?	exc
F	Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.	exc
M	[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?	exc
F	That was the first time you hit me.	xxx
M	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	exc
F	And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER]	xxx
M	I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]	exc
F	How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous	xxx
M	We were very much younger then.	exc
F	Very much sillier.	xxx
M	Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden.	xxx
F	You knew there was nothing in that.	neu

M	Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.	xxx
F	Oh You knew there was nothing in that.	xxx
M	I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.	xxx
F	Only a trivial little broach.	neu
M	I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.	xxx
F	Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.	neu
M	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	xxx
F	[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	fru
M	You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?	fru
F	Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.	neu
M	He let him kiss you.  You said you did.	fru
F	Well, what of it.	neu
M	what of it?	xxx
F	Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	neu
M	What about me?	xxx
F	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.	xxx
M	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	ang
F	I'm getting very bored with this conversation.	fru
M	Me, too, bored stiff.	ang
M	Do you want some brandy?	neu
F	No thanks.	neu
M	I think I'll have a little.	neu
F	I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.	xxx
M	No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.	xxx
F	Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.	xxx
M	You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.	xxx
F	It's becoming a habit with you.	neu
M	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.	xxx
F	Don't be stupid.	fru
M	Amanda, really.	ang
F	What?	xxx
M	Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?	fru
F	Just making myself fascinating for you.	neu
M	Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.	fru
F	It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?	xxx
M	Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	xxx
F	No, it isn't.	ang
M	Yes, it is.	xxx
F	No, it it is not, be quiet.	ang
M	It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	ang
F	hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	xxx
M	oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder.	xxx
F	Adders don't snap, they sting.	xxx
M	Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!	fru
F	They sting.	fru
M	They snap.	ang
F	Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?	xxx
M	So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	neu
F	Yes, I did quite a lot.	neu
M	You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	ang
F	[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.	xxx
M	I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.	ang
F	You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.	fru
M	I am not the slightest bit drunk.	ang
F	You always had a weak head.	neu
M	I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	ang
F	Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.	xxx
M	Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	ang
F	Not- Would you shut up.	ang
M	You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.	ang
F	You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy.	fru
M	You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	ang
M	You better turn that off, I think.	ang
F	Why?	xxx
M	Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	ang
F	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.	xxx
M	Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	ang
F	They're away in Tunis.	xxx
M	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	ang
F	Turn it on again, please.	xxx
M	I do I shall do no such thing.	ang
F	Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.	ang
M	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	ang
F	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.	ang
M	Turn it off!	ang
F	Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.	ang
M	Very amusing indeed.	ang
F	You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.	ang
M	Ja! Very funny.	ang
F	Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.	ang
M	You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	ang
F	This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.	ang
M	Oh, you're not going like this.	ang
F	Yes, I am. Let go with me	ang
M	[GARBAGE] No, you're not.	ang
F	You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!	ang
M	oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	ang
F	Beast	ang
M	You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.	ang
F	Brute	ang
F	pig	ang

Ross Geller	I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.	Mad
Joey Tribbiani	I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.	Neutral
Chandler Bing	It's a beautiful thing.	Joyful
Joey Tribbiani	What's this?	Neutral

Joey Tribbiani	Done with the bookcase!	Joyful
Chandler Bing	All finished!	Joyful

Chandler Bing	Oh, God.	Sad
Joey Tribbiani	You got screwed.	Mad
Chandler Bing	Oh my God!	Mad

Monica Geller	Oh my God!	Mad
Paul the Wine Guy	I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?	Sad
Monica Geller	My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?	Sad
Paul the Wine Guy	Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-	Powerful
Monica Geller	-leg?	Joyful
Paul the Wine Guy	That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.	Joyful

Ross Geller	I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!	Sad

Chandler Bing	You must stop!	Mad
Ross Geller	That only took me an hour.	Sad
Chandler Bing	Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!	Sad
Ross Geller	You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...	Scared
Joey Tribbiani	What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!	Powerful
Ross Geller	I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.	Scared
Chandler Bing	Stay out of my freezer!	Mad

Paul the Wine Guy	Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...	Sad
Monica Geller	What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?	Neutral
Paul the Wine Guy	No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.	Sad

Paul the Wine Guy	Isn't there?	Scared
Monica Geller	Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?	Neutral
Paul the Wine Guy	Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.	Sad

Paul the Wine Guy	So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?	Neutral
Monica Geller	...Yeah. Yeah, I do.	Neutral

Ross Geller	Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?	Peaceful
Joey Tribbiani	Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,	Scared
Chandler Bing	Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.	Joyful

Monica Geller	You know Paul?	Neutral
Franny	Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.	Neutral
Monica Geller	You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?	Neutral
Franny	Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.	Neutral

Joey Tribbiani	Of course it was a line!	Mad
Monica Geller	Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?	Mad
Ross Geller	I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.	Neutral
Monica Geller	I hate men! I hate men!	Mad
Phoebe Buffay	Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.	Peaceful
Monica Geller	Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?	Mad
Phoebe Buffay	All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.	Peaceful
Monica Geller	I just thought he was nice, y'know?	Sad
Joey Tribbiani	I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!	Joyful
Rachel Green	Guess what?	Neutral
Ross Geller	You got a job?	Neutral
Rachel Green	Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.	Mad
Chandler Bing	And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.	Neutral
Rachel Green	You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!	Joyful

Phoebe Buffay	I can't believe what I'm hearing here...	Joyful
Monica Geller	What? I-I said you had a-	Scared
Phoebe Buffay	What I said you had...	Joyful
Monica Geller	Would you stop?	Mad
Phoebe Buffay	Oh, was I doing it again?	Neutral
#ALL#	Yes!	Mad
Monica Geller	I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.	Peaceful
Joey Tribbiani	Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.	Joyful
Ross Geller	There's an image.	Neutral
Rachel Green	Would anybody like more coffee?	Peaceful
Chandler Bing	Did you make it, or are you just serving it?	Scared
Rachel Green	I'm just serving it.	Neutral
#ALL#	Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.	Joyful

Ross Geller	'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?	Joyful
Monica Geller	No, no, I don't.	Scared
Rachel Green	Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?	Joyful
Ross Geller	My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?	Neutral
Chandler Bing	Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!	Joyful
Monica Geller	Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?	Neutral
Ross Geller	Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...	Neutral
Monica Geller	Why don't you just get a roommate?	Neutral
Ross Geller	Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.	Sad

David	...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.	Powerful
Phoebe Buffay	Okay, alright, I have a question, then.	Neutral
David	Yuh.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?	Neutral
David	Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.	Joyful
Phoebe Buffay	Sure.	Neutral
David	Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.	Scared
Phoebe Buffay	Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.	Joyful
David	Rrrreally.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.	Joyful
David	...Now? Now?	Scared
Phoebe Buffay	Oh yeah, right now.	Powerful
David	Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.	Neutral
David	Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?	Joyful
Phoebe Buffay	I can hop.	Joyful

Phoebe Buffay	Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?	Joyful
Max	Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'	Mad
David	Thank you, Max. Thank you.	Peaceful
Phoebe Buffay	So-so you're really not going?	Neutral
David	I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Oh don't do that.	Scared
David	Please.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Oh no no.	Neutral
David	No, but I'm asking-	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Oh, but I can't do that-	Neutral
David	No, but I can't-	Scared
Phoebe Buffay	It's your thing, and-	Neutral
David	-make the decision-	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Okay, um, stay.	Neutral
David	Stay.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Stay.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Getting so good at that!	Joyful
David	It was Max's stuff.	Peaceful

Rachel Green	It was unbelievable!	Joyful
Monica Geller	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!	Joyful
Phoebe Buffay	Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?	Joyful
Rachel Green	Oh, it ended very well.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Oh.	Neutral
Monica Geller	Do not start without me. Do not start without me.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?	Joyful
Rachel Green	Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.	Joyful
Phoebe Buffay	Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?	Neutral
Rachel Green	No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.	Joyful
Monica Geller	Ohhhh.	Joyful

Mr. Ratstatter	This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.	Joyful
Monica Geller	So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.	Neutral
Mr. Ratstatter	Mockolate.	Neutral
Monica Geller	I'm sorry?	Scared
Mr. Ratstatter	Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.	Neutral
Monica Geller	Ohh.	Scared
Mr. Ratstatter	Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.	Powerful
Monica Geller	All right. Mmm-mmm.	Mad
Mr. Ratstatter	Yeah?	Neutral
Monica Geller	I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.	Mad
Mr. Ratstatter	No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.	Powerful
Monica Geller	Mmm-mmm.	Mad
Mr. Ratstatter	But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.	Powerful
Monica Geller	Wow.	Neutral
Mr. Ratstatter	Aren't you going to swallow that?	Neutral
Monica Geller	Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.	Mad
Mr. Ratstatter	Yeah, isn't that great?	Powerful
Monica Geller	Mmm.	Mad
Mr. Ratstatter	Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?	Powerful

Mr. Ratstatter	Really?	Powerful
Monica Geller	Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.	Joyful

Monica Geller	How about Mockolate mousse?	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.	Mad
Monica Geller	Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?	Neutral

Monica Geller	We'll put buckles on it.	Joyful
Rachel Green	Hey.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Hey.	Neutral
Monica Geller	Hey.	Neutral
Rachel Green	Did uh, Ross call?	Neutral
Monica Geller	No, I'm sorry.	Sad
Rachel Green	Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."	Mad
Phoebe Buffay	No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.	Powerful

Ross Geller	I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.	Scared
Chandler Bing	Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.	Mad
Joey Tribbiani	Hey, here's a thought, Ross.	Peaceful
Chandler Bing	Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.	Mad
Joey Tribbiani	Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.	Joyful
Chandler Bing	Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.	Peaceful
Ross Geller	Can't we just use a pen?	Neutral
Chandler Bing	No, Amish boy.	Joyful
Joey Tribbiani	Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.	Neutral
Ross Geller	I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.	Peaceful
Joey Tribbiani	You could say that.	Neutral
Ross Geller	And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.	Peaceful
Chandler Bing	Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?	Joyful
Ross Geller	I don't know.	Neutral
Joey Tribbiani	Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.	Joyful
Chandler Bing	Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?	Neutral
Ross Geller	She's not Rachel.	Sad

Monica Geller	Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.	Neutral
Rachel Green	Oh my god.	Mad
Monica Geller	Oh my god good?	Scared
Rachel Green	Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.	Mad
Phoebe Buffay	Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!	Sad

Chandler Bing	My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.	Joyful
Monica Geller	You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.	Powerful
Phoebe Buffay	I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.	Scared
Joey Tribbiani	Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	What?	Neutral
Monica Geller	What?	Neutral
Chandler Bing	Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.	Joyful
Monica Geller	This was your idea?	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	What were you thinking?	Neutral
Chandler Bing	All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.	Peaceful
Monica Geller	Yeah. You!	Neutral
Chandler Bing	All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?	Scared
Phoebe Buffay	Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.	Neutral

Ross Geller	Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!	Scared
Rachel Green	When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.	Mad
Ross Geller	I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.	Neutral
Rachel Green	Not interested.	Mad
Ross Geller	Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.	Neutral
Ross Geller	Number six: the way you smell.	Peaceful

Rachel Green	No.	Mad
Ross Geller	No?	Scared
Rachel Green	That's what I said.	Mad
Chandler Bing	Look, maybe we should go?	Scared
Rachel Green	No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.	Mad
Ross Geller	Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.	Scared
Rachel Green	No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.	Sad
Ross Geller	No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.	Peaceful
Rachel Green	Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!	Sad
Ross Geller	You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.	Peaceful
Rachel Green	Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.	Scared
Joey Tribbiani	I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.	Scared

Monica Geller	Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.	Neutral
Mr. Ratstatter	Doesn't matter.	Neutral
Monica Geller	What?	Scared
Mr. Ratstatter	Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.	Sad
Monica Geller	Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.	Sad
Mr. Ratstatter	Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?	Sad
Monica Geller	Well, uh, I ate some.	Scared
Mr. Ratstatter	Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?	Neutral

Monica Geller	Hello?	Neutral
Ross Geller	Hi.	Neutral
Rachel Green	Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.	Peaceful
Monica Geller	Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.	Neutral
Ross Geller	Look, can, can you do something for me?	Scared
Monica Geller	Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?	Powerful
Radio	The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.	Powerful
Radio	Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.	Joyful

Mr. Ratstatter	Hi, thanks for coming in again.	Neutral
Monica Geller	Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.	Sad
Mr. Ratstatter	It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?	Neutral
Monica Geller	Cat hair.	Sad
Mr. Ratstatter	Oh, sorry.	Sad

Monica Geller	Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.	Joyful
Richard Burke	Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.	Joyful
Richard Burke	Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?	Powerful
Monica Geller	Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.	Joyful
Richard Burke	What're you doing?	Neutral
Monica Geller	Just waiting for you sweetie.	Joyful
Richard Burke	Are you remaking the bed?	Neutral
Monica Geller	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.	Sad
Richard Burke	Then, you're redoing it because...	Neutral
Monica Geller	If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.	Sad
Richard Burke	You're pretty much running that risk either way.	Scared
Monica Geller	Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.	Sad
Richard Burke	Oh, well that's not so crazy.	Neutral
Monica Geller	I'm just easing you in.	Joyful
Richard Burke	Oh, alright.	Neutral
Monica Geller	Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.	Peaceful
Richard Burke	Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.	Peaceful
Monica Geller	Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.	Joyful

Chandler Bing	Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.	Neutral
Joey Tribbiani	But don't you need experience for a job like that?	Scared
Chandler Bing	It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.	Peaceful
Scott Alexander	Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.	Joyful
Chandler Bing	Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.	Mad
Scott Alexander	No kidding.	Peaceful
Joey Tribbiani	Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.	Powerful
Scott Alexander	Where do you work?	Neutral
Joey Tribbiani	Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.	Neutral
Chandler Bing	I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.	Neutral
Scott Alexander	Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...	Joyful
Joey Tribbiani	Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?	Joyful

Rachel Green	Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.	Joyful
Monica Geller	You look fabulous honey, you really do.	Joyful

Ryan	What's goin' on?	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.	Sad
Ryan	Chicken or small?	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.	Joyful
Ryan	Why aren't you at home in bed?	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.	Joyful
Ryan	I'm sorry, I never had 'em.	Scared
Phoebe Buffay	Ohh, ohh.	Scared
Ryan	If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.	Powerful
Phoebe Buffay	Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.	Mad
Ryan	Can I please see your face?	Neutral
Phoebe Buffay	Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.	Scared
Ryan	Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.	Peaceful
Phoebe Buffay	And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.	Scared
Ryan	Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.	Peaceful
Phoebe Buffay	I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.	Sad
Ryan	Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.	Joyful
Phoebe Buffay	Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.	Joyful

Joey Tribbiani	Hey.	Neutral
Chandler Bing	Hey, how's the first day goin'?	Peaceful
